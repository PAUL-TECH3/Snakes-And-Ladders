# Snakes-And-Ladders

This repo contains my first app made in Android Studio. It helped grasp basic understanding of how app works and how to make one using android studio. Its a basic snakes & ladders game which can be improved further but since I didn't know much about android studio when I was making it So you might run into some issues.

### How to run:
* You can download the apk and install the app.
* You can build and run the project in src in Android Studio.

### Future Work/Improvements:
The app currently uses hard coded values for pixels thus it works find on my screen but I can't say the same for every screen. One possible solution is to make player movement relative to the screen instead of absolute so it would work fine on every screen. Another thing that can be added is multiplayer option where you can play with a player instead of AI.
